The courses in the Computer Science program for SNHU, were inclusive to many different areas of computer science. Which helped build a great foundation and give room to explore and find a subfield to specialize in. This enhanced and helped showcase my strengths of effective problem solving skills, willingness to learn, and adaptability. It also helped form hard skills and soft skills that are crucial in a professional environment and makes me more employable in the computer science field. 

# Collaborating In a Team Environment
I’m very comfortable operating in team environments and have frequently been exposed to different methodologies and philosophies of teamwork. For instance, CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle improved my soft skills of collaborating in a team environment as it taught me the inner workings of the different philosophies of software development like agile and devops. Both of which require strong communication between team members and other teams to be successful. 

# Communicating With Stakeholders
Communicating with non-technical people like stakeholders is a valuable skill to have and it was strengthened during the course CS-255: System Analysis and Design, which focused on interviewing an owner of a company and understanding the wants and needs of the client and designing the system around those wants and needs. 

# Data Structures and Algorithms
Courses like CS-210: Programming Languages and IT-145: Foundations in Application Development really helped foster algorithmic thinking and a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms based on performance, memory, and maintainability trade-offs.

# Databases
With courses like DAD-220: Introduction to Structures Database Environments, I’ve learned to connect that bridge between front-end and back-end and have become quite proficient in query optimization, forming indexing strategies, and database modeling.  

# Security
From the very beginning of my journey at SNHU in the computer science program, security has been at the forefront of every project. With courses like CS-305: Software Security and CS-405: Secure Coding, I’ve become very proficient in understanding and implementing industry-standard secure coding principles and the ethical responsibilities behind being a professional in the computer science field. 

Below is some of my work that showcases my skills that I’ve highlighted above in real coding projects. They encompass three categories: Software Engineering and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. Each one shows that I can design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer sciences practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing trade-offs involved in design choices,  Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, and develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.


Here is the First code review: [![Module Two Code Review](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iahhYUW6S3Q/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iahhYUW6S3Q)

# Artifact One
[Artifact Enhancement One](https://github.com/IllILevi/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/tree/main/CS-499_Enhancement_One)
The artifact I’ve chosen for this category is the from the IT-145: Foundation in Application Development project. This program helps keep track of search and rescue animals by taking them in, training them, and allowing for them to be reserved.
I chose this artifact because it showed my early understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java and I felt there was plenty of room to improve upon the original code. My enhancement plan involved converting this code into C++ as well as implementing industry-standard security principles. This goal wasn’t to simply convert a Java program into C++ syntax, but rather to center the program design in a way that is idiomatic to the C++ language. The skills showcased in doing this isn’t just simply proving I know two programming languages, instead, it shows that I have a strong understanding of software architecture and design, good problem solving skills, and a deep understanding of unique C++ features. The artifact was improved by making it more memory efficient and faster due to the nature of the two programming languages as well as adding proper input validation when appropriate.
The two course outcomes that I planned to meet for this category is as follows:
Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.
I believe I have met both of these course outcomes with my enhancements.
Working on enhancing this artifact was quite the learning experience for me. I was already relatively comfortable with the C++ language, but this was my first time converting a program of this size to another programming language and since C++ is such a technical language, I certainly faced challenges along the way. For instance, how to best implement OOP principles that are still idiomatic to C++ or how to properly utilize and manage smart pointers and references. By encountering and overcoming these challenges, I’ve not only learned so much more about C++ and programming in general, I was able to further reinforce concepts that I’ve previously understood and implement them into the design.


# Artifact Two
[Artifact Enhancement Two](https://github.com/IllILevi/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/tree/main/CS-499_Enhancement_Two)
The artifact I’ve chosen for this category is CS-300: DSA Analysis and Design. This program reads a file filled with courses and sorts them alphanumerically by course ID and prints it to the console. Then it further prompts the user to ask about a single course and it will print out the class along with its prerequisites. 
I chose this artifact because it showcases my understanding of different sorting algorithms not only from a conceptual standpoint but a practical one as well. It shows that I can consider the strengths and weaknesses of different data structures and algorithms and am able to justify using one over the other in order to find the most efficient one given the context of the program and my data. The artifact was improved by giving a practical demonstration on which sorting algorithm is the fastest in sorting two types of files: The original one that was in the class CS-300 called FileTest.csv and my own file, DummyData.txt that I created, which has a lot more courses (500 total). I also took the space complexity of sorting algorithms into consideration and found that Quick Sort was the best choice for the program.
The course outcome I believe I met with this enhancement is 
Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  
I had never implemented Merge Sort before this artifact, so it was a process of figuring out how it worked conceptually and then how to implement it into my program. There was also, of course, the research phase on thinking about which sorting algorithm would be best in a theoretical sense. Thankfully, I didn't run into any serious challenges, this program is relatively straight forward. There was a small issue where almost all of the sorting algorithms were performing too quickly on the data to where the clock() function would only return 0 seconds, so I had to implement a high resolution clock to track the sorting process down to the microsecond.

# Artifact Three
[Artifact Enhancement Two(https://github.com/IllILevi/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/tree/main/CS-499_Enhancement_Three)
The artifact I’ve chosen for this category is the CS-340: Client/Server Development project. This program is for a search and rescue service that takes data from various animal shelters around the city of Austin, Texas and filters the dogs based on breed into four types of search and rescue. With the help of certain libraries we present this data in a way that is both comprehensive and visually appealing. I chose this artifact because it demonstrates my understanding of the Python language both basic and advanced concepts of MongoDB, the Python framework Dash, and finally, the Jupyter Notebook to test and run the code. I improved this artifact by porting this project to a more practical environment i.e. my local machine instead of a virtual desktop like what the project was originally developed in. 
I believe upon enhancing this artifact, I’ve completed the course outcomes I’ve planned to meet. This includes the following:
Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  
Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
When first doing this project for the course CS-340: Client/Server Development, some things were already done for you, for instance, MongoDB and Jupyter Notebook were already installed and set up for. So this was my first time setting up both a client side and a database locally. I would say I learned the most about the different libraries that were used for this project especially after reviewing the documentation for each one. There were not too many challenges I faced with the enhancement.
